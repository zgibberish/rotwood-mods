# Hi
Here you can find a compilation of documentations/guides + some other goodies that I either have collected or written myself about Rotwood, mostly about (but not exclusive to) modding.

# Catalogue

## Guides

- [Extracting game scripts](docs/extracting_game_scripts.md)

- [Enabling dev tools](docs/enabling_devtools.md)

- [Loading mods](docs/loading_mods.md)

## Mods

These are the mods that I've made for Rotwood, you can find them in the `mods` folder. More mods will be uploaded soon. If some mods get too out of hand I may put them in their own repositories for better version control.
