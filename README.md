## Mods

Below are some mods that I've made for Rotwood:

- [Mod Menu](https://github.com/zgibberish/rotwood-modmenu)
- (Outdated) Vertical Settings Tab Icons: Changes the tabs in the game options screen to show icons on top of text, so they're easier to read.

(Outdated) You can find some images of the above mods in the `img` folder.

TODO: Remove and update outdated mods (preferably in their own repositories and add a link here)
