# Hi
Here you can find a compilation of documentations/guides + some other goodies that I either have collected or written myself about Rotwood, mostly about (but not exclusive to) modding.

# Catalogue

## Guides

- [Extracting game scripts](docs/extracting_game_scripts.md)

- [Enabling dev tools](docs/enabling_devtools.md)

- [Loading mods](docs/loading_mods.md)

- [Extracting game audio files](docs/extracting_audio.md)

## Mods

These are the mods that I've made for Rotwood, you can find them in the `mods` folder. More mods will be uploaded soon. If some mods get too out of hand I may put them in their own repositories for better version control.

- Mod Menu (["(Optional) Mod Menu" section in "Loading mods"](docs/loading_mods.md)) : GUI to view and manage installed mods, adds a "Mods" tab to the game options screen.
- Vertical Settings Tab Icons : Changes the tabs in the game options screen to show icons on top of text, so they're easier to read.

You can find some images of the above mods in the `img` folder.
