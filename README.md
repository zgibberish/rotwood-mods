## Mods

Below are some mods that I've made for Rotwood:

- [Mod Menu](https://github.com/zgibberish/rotwood-modmenu)
- (Outdated) Vertical Settings Tab Icons: Changes the tabs in the game options screen to show icons on top of text, so they're easier to read.

- [Enemy Health Bars](https://github.com/zgibberish/rotwood-enemyhealthbars)
