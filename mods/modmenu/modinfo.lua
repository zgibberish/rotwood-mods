If you need to re-enable this mod, either do \"KnownModIndex:Enable(\"modmenu\") KnownModIndex:Save()\" in the debug console and reload, or, you can remove the mod from the mods/ folder and place it back in again, because the mod loader automatically enables newly installed mods. This also works for any other mods.</i>"
