# Linux Discord Rich Presence

This is not a thing specific to Rotwood but it's useful info that I think should be included.

Windows games running on Linux under Wine may be a little finicky with Discord RPC, either it doesn't show up or only show the game's name. I found that this method fixes the problem, and I thought it'd be useful to share.
